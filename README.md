**AI-Augmented Hybrid Imaging for Ab Initio Protein Folding Without MSAs**

---

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to **predict 3D protein structures directly from sparse, noisy Cryo-EM and X-ray data** ‚Äî without relying on **Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs)**, which are a core limitation in current models like AlphaFold.

- **Input:**  
  - Cryo-EM 2D class averages (low-resolution)  
  - Partial X-ray crystallography maps (incomplete data)  

- **Model:**  
  - 3D diffusion transformer (similar to AlphaFold3, conditioned on imaging data)  
  - Neural Cryo-EM denoiser (pre-trained to "hallucinate" missing density)  

- **Output:**  
  - Full atomic structures, even for orphan proteins with no evolutionary relatives.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Pipeline
1. **Raw CIF file ‚Üí 3D volume conversion**  
   - 3D scatter plot of atomic positions  
   - Orthogonal slices through volume  

2. **Synthetic Cryo-EM generation**  
   - Added realistic noise artifacts  
   - Side-by-side clean vs noisy slices  

3. **Input/Target Pairs**  
   - Model receives noisy input  
   - Learns to predict clean structure

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Architecture
- Diffusion process: transforms random noise into protein structures  
- Conditioned on Cryo-EM/X-ray features  
- Transformer layers capture 3D atomic relationships  
- Cross-attention fuses modalities:
  - Cryo-EM ‚Üí low-res global structure  
  - X-ray ‚Üí high-res local structure
